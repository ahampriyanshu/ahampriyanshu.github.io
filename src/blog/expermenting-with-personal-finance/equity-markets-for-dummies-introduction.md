The democratisation of investing is pretty <s>dangerous</s> beautiful. Thanks to the bull run after the COVID crash, more than 7 crores new demat accounts have opened since 2019. But, how many of us are actually beating returns generated by MFs(or even FDs)? If not, then what are we missing? In the end, returns on MFs and FDs are also generated from the same market(let's assume the debt/bond/commodity market is not a part of this discussion). In this three-part series, I am trying to figure out the same question.

## Trading Hours

| Session | Time Window | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Pre-Opening Session | 9:00 AM - 9:15 AM | Order placement and matching phase |
| Regular Trading Hours | 9:15 AM - 3:30 PM | Main trading window for retail investors |
| Post-Market Session | 3:30 PM - 4:00 PM | Primarily for brokers to settle trades |
| After Market Orders (AMO) | 4:00 PM - 9:00 AM (next day) | Place orders when markets are closed |

### Why Pre-Opening is needed

Imagine if markets opened directly at 9:00 AM. Overnight, major news breaks:
- Company announces fantastic results at 5:30 PM
- Or global markets crash while we're sleeping
- Or RBI announces surprise rate cut on a weekend/holiday

Without pre-opening, big institutional traders (who monitor news 24/7) place orders instantly at 9:00 AM, while regular retail investors (you and me) are still processing the news. This results in stock opening at extreme price (very high or very low), and by the time you react, the opportunity is gone and you end up buying/selling at unfair prices.

### How Pre-Opening saves retail investors

**Phase 1: Order Collection (9:00-9:07 AM)**
- Everyone places orders - institutions, retail traders, everyone
- No trades execute yet, just orders collected
- You have 7 minutes to process overnight news and place your order

**Phase 2: Order Matching (9:08-9:11 AM)**
- System runs an algorithm to find equilibrium price
- Calculates: "At what price can maximum shares be traded?"
- All buy and sell orders are matched at this SINGLE price

**Phase 3: Buffer Period (9:12-9:15 AM)**
- Opening price is displayed but frozen
- No new orders can be placed/modified
- Everyone can see where market will open

**Outcome:** Level playing field - your 9:02 AM order has same priority as institutional order. No one gets advantage, everyone gets same opening price.

> **Note:** Pre-opening is like a "democracy vote" for opening price instead of a "fastest finger first" game. It protects small investors from being at a disadvantage against institutional players with faster systems and 24/7 news monitoring.

## Market Timings

### Markets are OPEN
- Monday to Friday (9:15 AM - 3:30 PM)
- Special Session - Muhurat Trading: Diwali evening (1 hour, around 6-7 PM).
- Orders placed on weekends/holidays queue as AMO and execute next working day at 9:15 AM.

### Markets are CLOSED
- Weekends (Saturday & Sunday)
- National holidays and major festivals (Republic Day, Independence Day, Holi, Diwali, Christmas, etc.)

## Settlement Cycle

Indian equity markets operate on a **T+1 settlement cycle**, where trades execute immediately but settlement occurs one working day later.

**Settlement Examples:**
- The "T" stands for Trade date, "+1" means add 1 working day
- Trade on Monday → Settlement on Tuesday
- Trade on Friday → Settlement on Monday (skips weekend)

> **Note:** India moved from T+2 to T+1 settlement(and T+0 for select stocks) in January 2023, making it one of the fastest settlement cycles globally.

## Types of Markets

| Feature | Primary Market | Secondary Market |
|---------|----------------|------------------|
| **Purpose** | To raise fresh capital | To trade existing securities |
| **Type of Offering** | IPO (first-time) or FPO (additional capital) | Already-listed shares |
| **Transaction Between** | Company ↔ Investor | Investor ↔ Investor |
| **Price Discovery** | Book-building process | Market forces (demand & supply) |

**Example:**
- **Primary Market:** Zomato IPO (2021) - Company [raised ₹9,375 Cr](https://www.chittorgarh.com/ipo/zomato-ipo/1126/) directly from investors. Money goes to the promoters of the company.
- **Secondary Market:** Buying Zomato shares on NSE - Money goes to the seller (and not Zomato)

## IPOs

Lately, IPOs have become a very popular way to gain good returns in the short term without any risk (or research). Just follow the GMP and the subscription ratio to decide if you want to apply for the IPO. The fundamentals of a company can be bleaker than the future of women's rights organisations in Afghanistan. The primary reason for the IPO could be to pay some bad loan or promoter's pressure to exit. But as long as there is hype in the market for the IPO, you can expect a good return. I won't say this is not true, but always make sure to categorize such investments in a completely different (isolated) bucket and never mix it with your long-term investments. Otherwise, you might end up holding the next [Paytm](https://in.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=NSE%3APAYTM) or [Nykaa](https://in.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=NSE%3ANYKAA).

Also, don't give up when consecutive IPO applications are rejected. That is how any lottery system works. You will never get the winning ticket, while your brother, your friend, his brother, his brother's friend will get it. Anyone and everyone will get it, except you. But still, iff you want to make this the art of picking IPOs a bit more scientific, you can use the following framework:

1. Download the Red Herring Prospectus (RHPS) from the company's website.
2. Read the RHPS carefully and understand the business model and management of the company.
3. Check the financials of the company and verify 
    1. If the company is profitable.
    2. If the revenue is growing.
    3. Total assets are greater than total liabilities.
    4. PAT is healthy and consistent.
4. Google the company and read the recent news articles about the company. Check for any recent scandals or controversies.
5. Go on [Chittorgarh](https://www.chittorgarh.com/) and see the current GMP of the company. At minimum, it should be 10% above the upper band. Anything greater than 20% is a good sign.
6. Check the subscription ratio. Once it is more than 3x, you can consider applying for the IPO.

## Investor Categories

| Category | Full Form | Threshold/Definition | Examples |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|----------|
| **RII** | Retail Individual Investors | Investment < ₹2 lakhs in IPOs | You, me, salaried professionals, small traders |
| **HNI** | High Net Worth Individuals | Investment > ₹2 lakhs in IPOs | Business owners, wealthy individuals, family offices |
| **DII** | Domestic Institutional Investors | Indian institutions managing pooled money | SBI Mutual Fund, LIC, HDFC AMC, ICICI Prudential, UTI |
| **FII/FPI** | Foreign Institutional/Portfolio Investors | International investors bringing foreign capital | Government of Singapore, Europacific Growth Fund |

## Types of Orders

| Order Type | What It Is | Example | Risk/Note |
|------------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Market Order** | Executes immediately at current market price | Reliance at ₹2,500 → Order executes at ₹2,499-₹2,501 | Slippage - actual price may differ from screen price in volatile markets |
| **Limit Order** | You set maximum buy price or minimum sell price | TCS at ₹3,500, you place limit at ₹3,450 → Executes only if TCS drops to ₹3,450 or below | May never execute if price doesn't reach your limit |
| **Stop Loss Market** | Safety net - auto sells if price falls to trigger | Buy at ₹1,600, trigger at ₹1,520 → Hits ₹1,520 → Sells immediately at market | Execution guaranteed but final price uncertain (could be ₹1,520 or ₹1,515) |
| **Stop Loss Limit** | Safety net with price range control | Trigger ₹95, Limit ₹93 → Hits ₹95 → Sells only between ₹95-₹93 | If price crashes past your limit instantly (₹95→₹92), order won't execute |
| **IOC (Immediate or Cancel)** | Execute now or cancel completely | Want to buy 1,000 shares, only 300 available → Gets 300, cancels 700 | All-or-nothing execution at current moment |
| **GTC (Good Till Cancelled)** | Order stays active until filled or manually cancelled | Place limit order on Monday → Stays active till Friday or until you cancel | Remember to cancel manually or it stays indefinitely |
| **Disclosed Quantity** | Large order showing only small portion to market | Want 10,000 shares but show only 500 at a time | Prevents tipping off other traders about your big position |

## Gap Opening

Markets rarely open exactly where they closed. After-market orders accumulate overnight, creating supply-demand imbalances.

**Gap Up Opening** - Opening price exceeds previous close, indicating positive overnight sentiment.

**Gap Down Opening** - Opening price falls below previous close, signaling negative overnight news.

## Circuit Breakers

Price band limits preventing extreme single-day volatility, typically set at 5%, 10%, or 20% bands.

**Common Circuit Limits:**
- **5% circuit** - Large-cap stocks
- **10% circuit** - Mid-cap stocks
- **20% circuit** - Small-cap and volatile stocks

### Market-Wide Circuit Breakers (Index Level)

Beyond individual stocks, the NSE and BSE also have circuit breakers that halt **ALL** trading when indices fall/rise sharply.

| Change from previous day's close | Action | Trading halt duration |
|-------------------------------|--------|----------------------|
| **10% change** | 🟡 Level 1 Circuit | 45 minutes |
| **15% change** | 🟠 Level 2 Circuit | 1 hour 45 minutes |
| **20% change** | 🔴 Level 3 Circuit | Rest of the day |

#### Instances when market circuit breakers were hit

**2009 Lok Sabha Election Results**
- **Impact:** SENSEX locked at 14,272.62(+17.24%), NIFTY locked at 4,308.05(+17.33%). 
- **Reason:** UPA II returned to power with better majority, no more dependency on the Left.

**COVID-19 Crash (March 2020)**
- **Impact:** SENSEX crashed 13.15%, NIFTY down 12.98%. Level 2 (15%) circuit breaker triggered
- **Reason:** Global pandemic panic, nationwide lockdown announced

**Harshad Mehta Scam (1992)**
- **Impact:** SENSEX plunged 12.77%
- **Reason:** Securities scam exposure, massive manipulation uncovered

**Global Financial Crisis (2008)**
- **Impact:** 10%+ crashes on multiple days
- **Reason:** Lehman Brothers collapsed, global banking crisis

> **Note:** Circuit breakers protect the entire market from panic selling or euphoria. They give investors time to think rationally rather than selling/buying in fear. Sharp rallies often followed by [equally sharp corrections](https://www.screener.in/company/519477/consolidated/).

## Face Value

**Face Value**: Nominal value printed on share certificate, used for dividend calculations and corporate actions. It is fixed when the company issues shares (typically ₹1, ₹5, or ₹10) and only changes through stock splits/consolidations. Dividends, rights ratios, and preference share coupons are declared as a percentage of face value.

**Market Value**: Current trading price determined by supply-demand dynamics.

**Example**: MRF face value = ₹10, market value = ₹1,55,000+

## Market Capitalisation

Market Cap = Total Outstanding Shares × Current Market Price
- **Large Caps**: Market cap > ₹10,000 crores (Blue-chip companies)
- **Mid Caps**: Market cap between ₹500 - ₹10,000 crores
- **Small Caps**: Market cap < ₹500 crores

### Free Float Market Cap

It is the total market value of a company's shares that are available to be traded by the public. Index calculations use free float, not total market cap as total market cap also includes shares held by promoters.

| Component | Value | Explanation |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Total Shares | 1,00,00,000 | All shares issued by company |
| Promoter Holding | 60% | Locked with founders/promoters |
| Public Holding | 40% | Available for trading |
| Freely Floating Shares | 40,00,000 | Only these count |
| Market Price | ₹500 | Current trading price |
| **Free Float Market Cap** | **₹200 Crores** | 40,00,000 × ₹500 |

> **Note:** Higher free float = Better liquidity


## Market Indices

Market indices are used to track the performance of markets in a particular country or segment. Rising/falling indices are a good indicator of the overall market sentiment. However, you should not rely on indices alone to make investment decisions. In the last financial year, NIFTY dropped by more than 10%, while companies like InterGlobe(IndiGo), Airtel, Paytm and many more gave superb returns.

| Index | Country | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **NIFTY 50** | India(NSE) | Top 50 companies across sectors |
| **SENSEX** | India(BSE) | Top 30 established companies |
| **MCX iCOMDEX** | India(MCX) | Commodity Index tracking futures contracts (metals, energy) on the MCX |
| **India VIX** | India | A volatility index that measures market fear/uncertainty |
| **DOW** | USA(NYSE) | 30 large, influential blue-chip companies |
| **S&P 500** | USA | 500 of the largest US companies (key benchmark) |
| **NASDAQ 100** | USA(NASDAQ) | 100 largest non-financial (mostly tech) companies |
| **FTSE 100** | UK(LSE) | 100 largest companies on the London Stock Exchange |
| **CAC 40** | France(Euronext) | 40 largest companies on Euronext Paris |
| **DAX** | Germany | 40 largest companies on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange |
| **CSI 300** | China | Top 300 A-share stocks from Shanghai & Shenzhen |
| **Hang Seng** | Hong Kong | ~80 largest companies on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange |
| **Nikkei 225** | Japan | 225 top-rated companies on the Tokyo Stock Exchange |

## Tax Implications

Let's understand how profits are taxed depending on the holding period.

| Type | Holding Period | Tax Rate |
|------|----------------|----------|
| **LTCG** | > 1 year | 12.5% |
| **STCG** | ≤ 1 year | 20% |
| **Dividend** | Any | Added to income, taxed at slab rate |

A simple example to understand this better.

| Purchase Date | Sale Date | Shares | Purchase Price | Sale Price | Profit | Tax Rate | Taxed Amount | Net Profit |
|---------------|-----------|--------|----------------|------------|--------|----------------|-----|-----|
| Oct, 2025 | March, 2026 | 100 | ₹1,000 | ₹1,100 | ₹10,000 | 20% | ₹2,000 | ₹8,000 |
| Oct, 2025 | Dec, 2026 | 100 | ₹1,000 | ₹1,090 | ₹9,000 | 12.5% | ₹1,125 | ₹7,875 |

From the above example, we can see that the government incentivises long term investment by providing lower tax rates. But you should not take this as a reason to hold on to the stock for the long term.

## Corporate Actions

<figure class="align-center">
  <img src="/images/equity/infosys.png" alt="price history of infosys">
  <figcaption>Historical data of Infosys</figcaption>
</figure>

The chart above shows Infosys stock price growing from ₹95 to ₹1,500 over 30 years—a 15x return on paper. However, this only reflects price appreciation and ignores the massive impact of corporate actions like stock splits and bonus issues that multiplied shareholders' actual holdings.

### Dividends

It is the distribution of profits to shareholders based on face value(not market value). You can assume this as 'interest' earned on your long term investment.

#### Important terms

- **Announcement Date**: Corporate action declared by the board of directors.
- **Record Date**: Shareholders on this date receive benefits
- **Ex-Date**: Trades after this date don't qualify for announced benefits
- **Ex-Dividend ("Excluding Dividend")**: This describes a stock on or after the ex-dividend date. If you buy the stock now, you are buying it without the right to the dividend.
- **Cum-Dividend ("With Dividend")**: This describes a stock in the period before the ex-dividend date.
- **Dividend Yield**: The percentage of the current stock price that is paid out as dividends.
- **Interim Dividend**: A dividend paid out during the financial year, usually after half-year financial results.
- **Final Dividend**: A dividend declared at the end of the financial year, after the company's full results are audited and approved at the Annual General Meeting.

> **Note:** Dividends are paid out of the company's profits, not from the capital you invested. Also, not all companies pay dividends.

### Stock Split

When the company divides its shares into a larger number of shares, which increases the number of outstanding shares and reduces the price per share. For example, if you have 100 shares of a company @ Rs 50 per share and it splits 1:2. You will now have 200 shares @ Rs 25 per share. This is usually done to make the stock more affordable and attractive to small/retail investors.

> **Note:** Not all companies choose to split shares. MRF, for instance, hasn't split its stock since 1975—resulting in a current price of ₹1,55,000 per share. This deliberately high price acts as a barrier to speculative trading, attracting only experienced, long-term investors, who aren't affected by short-term market volatility. This strategy maintains price stability and cultivates an exclusivity around the stock.

### Bonus Share 

When a company issues additional shares to existing shareholders drawn from accumulated reserves or profits. For example, if you own 100 shares of a company and it declares a 1:1 bonus, you'll receive 100 additional shares—doubling your holding to 200 shares at no cost. This is typically done to reward loyal shareholders, improve liquidity, and signal strong financial health without affecting the company's overall market capitalization.

> **Note:** Unlike dividends, bonus shares are tax-free when received(only taxed upon sale). Companies with strong reserves often prefer bonus issues over cash dividends to conserve capital for growth while still rewarding shareholders. Indian IT giants like Infosys, TCS, and Wipro have consistently issued bonus shares over decades, significantly multiplying early investors' holdings.

### Effects on dividends

Bonus shares and stock splits multiply the number of shares you own. While individual dividend per share may reduce proportionally, your total dividend income remains the same initially. However, when companies raise dividends in the future, you benefit from a much larger shareholding—turning long term investments into substantial passive income streams over decades. 

## Retrospection 

Now, coming back to the question, how much you would have earned if you had invested ₹4,750 in Infosys at IPO in 1993?

| Date | Event | Ratio | Shares Owned |
|------|-------|-------|--------------|
| **1993** | **IPO - ₹95/share** | - | **50** |
| 1994 | Bonus Issue | 1:1 | 100 |
| 1997 | Bonus Issue | 1:1 | 200 |
| 1999 | Bonus Issue | 1:1 | 400 |
| 1999 | Stock Split | 2:1 | 800 |
| 2004 | Bonus Issue | 3:1 | 3,200 |
| 2006 | Bonus Issue | 1:1 | 6,400 |
| 2014 | Bonus Issue | 1:1 | 12,800 |
| 2015 | Bonus Issue | 1:1 | 25,600 |
| 2018 | Bonus Issue | 1:1 | 51,200 |

It would have grown to **₹7.64 Crores** - a CAGR of **26%** over 32 years. Through 8 bonus issues and 1 stock split, your original 50 shares would have multiplied **1,024 times** to 51,200 shares. And in this calculation, we are excluding the impact of dividend payouts. In 2025 alone, you would have earned **₹23 Lakhs** as dividends at the rate of ₹45 per share.

We will cover fundamental and tech analysis in the next post. But still want to give a reality check - none of us would have the patience to hold on to the stock for 30 years. If you would study the chart, you would notice that during the dot com bubble burst there was a bad period for the IT industry as a whole. Infosys(along with all the other IT giants) took a major hit and dropped to ₹10. At this time, you(and me) would have exited from the stock and booked heavy losses. Assuming that we can recover our original capital in intraday or even better, by entering into F&O segment of the market. Knowing the fundamentals of markets can help you understand in what you invest. Holding that stock through thick and thin is the true test of patience and discipline.

When I was in my second year of college, I had bought IRFC@21 and RVNL@27 for the long term. Within 1 year, I was getting 2x returns on my investment. Looked at "target price" from a few reputed analysts/amc and inflating RSI. Booked profits with the intention to re-enter after a correction. Guess what? IRFC peaked at 200+ and RVNL at 600+ and I never got the chance to re-enter. [Peter Lynch](https://www.amazon.in/One-Up-Wall-Street-Already-ebook/dp/B006YDFYW6/) managed billions for Fidelity with a simple philosophy: invest in what you know. He bought Dunkin' Donuts because his kids loved it, studied Taco Bell because he noticed long queues. Rakesh Jhunjhunwala bought Titan at ₹3 in 2002-2003 when everyone thought watches were dead(mobile phones became accessible to the public). Ramdeo Agrawal(Motilal Oswal) identified PI Industries in early 2000s, studied the agrochemicals space, understood the export opportunity, and even met the management. And you will find similar stories across different countries/markets. The common thread? They all understood what they owned, and had the **patience** to sit through market volatility. 

One last question, do you even need to hold a stock(or anything in life) this long? You were 25 in 1993. In 2025, you will be 57 years old! Even with all this money, can you really do what all you could have done in your 20s? The following is an advertisement from Air India from the 80s-90s.

What would have been more valuable for you? A trip to Europe when you were 25 or a 4BHK in Gurugram/Bangalore when you are 60. I guess, the answer is subjective. It depends on what one values more; the memories of a blissful experience or the pride of owning a valuable(again something very subjective) asset. 

So, before you invest in any asset, you should always predetermine the investing period and the purpose of the investment. Never let the panic or greed take over your decision making process. Now, the two major questions in equity markets are:

- What to buy?
- When to buy?

We will cover the first question in the next post.
