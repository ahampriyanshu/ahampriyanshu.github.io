Here's a thought experiment: What if you could buy a financial replica of yourself? Not a physical clone (that would be weird), but something that earns like you, provides like you, and steps in exactly when your family needs you most—when you're no longer around.

That's term insurance. It's the closest thing to a financial version of yourself that money can buy. Pay a small annual fee, and if you die, your family gets ₹1 crore, ₹5 crore, or even ₹10 crore. No complexity, no investment component—just pure, simple protection.

But here's the catch: buying term insurance without understanding the details is like buying a car without knowing if it has an engine. This guide walks you through everything you need to know.

## What Is Term Insurance? (And Why You Need It)

**The Simple Version:**

You pay ₹15,000 every year. If you die during the policy term, your family gets ₹1 crore. If you survive, you get nothing back.

**Why This Matters:**

You're the breadwinner. Your family depends on your ₹50,000 monthly income. You have:
- A home loan EMI of ₹25,000/month
- Kids' education expenses
- Daily household costs
- Your spouse who may not earn enough

**What Happens If You Die Tomorrow?**

Without insurance:
- Your family loses ₹50,000/month income
- Home loan of ₹60 lakhs still needs to be paid
- Kids' education (₹20 lakhs over 10 years) is at risk
- Savings dry up within 2-3 years

With ₹1 crore term insurance:
- Your family receives ₹1 crore
- They invest it in fixed deposits at 6% = ₹6 lakhs/year (₹50,000/month)
- Home loan gets paid off: ₹60 lakhs
- Remaining ₹40 lakhs covers education and emergency needs

**You've been financially replaced.**

## The Ironclad Promise

Term insurance companies have to pay. Unless:

1. **You commit suicide within 1 year** of buying the policy
2. **You die while committing a crime** (murder, terrorism, etc.)

That's it. Those are the only two exceptions.

**What About Fraud?**

The insurer has **3 years** to uncover fraud (like hiding medical conditions). After 3 years, they **must pay**, even if they later discover you lied.

**The Claim Process:**

Death → Nominee files claim → Insurance company verifies → Money paid within 30 days

**Real Statistics:**
- Average claim settlement ratio: 95%+
- Average claim processing time: 10-15 days
- Amount paid: Full sum assured (no deductions)

## How Much Cover Do You Need?

This is the ₹1 crore question. Literally.

### Method 1: The Human Life Value Approach

**Formula:** Annual Income × Years Till Retirement

**Example:**
- Your age: 30
- Retirement age: 60
- Annual income: ₹10 lakhs
- Cover needed: ₹10L × 30 years = **₹3 crores**

**Problem:** This doesn't account for existing savings, inflation, or changing needs.

### Method 2: The Need-Based Approach (Better)

**Calculate your family's total financial needs:**

```
Immediate Liabilities:
  Home loan outstanding          : ₹60,00,000
  Car loan outstanding           : ₹5,00,000
  Personal loan                  : ₹3,00,000
  Credit card debt               : ₹1,00,000
                                   -----------
  Total Debt                     : ₹69,00,000

Future Financial Goals:
  Children's education (2 kids)  : ₹40,00,000
  Children's marriage (2 kids)   : ₹30,00,000
  Emergency fund (2 years)       : ₹12,00,000
                                   -----------
  Total Goals                    : ₹82,00,000

Annual Income Replacement:
  Monthly expense                : ₹50,000
  Annual expense                 : ₹6,00,000
  Years of replacement needed    : 20 years
  Income replacement needed      : ₹1,20,00,000

TOTAL NEED                       : ₹2,71,00,000

Minus Existing Assets:
  Current savings                : ₹15,00,000
  Investments (FD, MF, stocks)   : ₹25,00,000
  Other insurance                : ₹10,00,000
                                   -----------
  Total Assets                   : ₹50,00,000

FINAL COVER NEEDED               : ₹2,21,00,000
Round up to                      : ₹2,50,00,000 (₹2.5 Crores)
```

### The Fixed Deposit Test

Whatever cover you choose, put it through the FD test:

**If your family gets ₹2.5 crores:**
- Invest in FD at 6% per year
- Annual interest: ₹15 lakhs
- Monthly income: ₹1,25,000

Can your family maintain their lifestyle on ₹1,25,000/month while paying off debts and funding goals?

**If yes:** Cover is adequate  
**If no:** Increase cover

### Quick Rules of Thumb

1. **Minimum cover:** 10x your annual income
2. **Ideal cover:** 15-20x your annual income
3. **If you have kids:** Add ₹50 lakhs per child
4. **If you have loans:** Add total outstanding loan amount

**Example:**
- Annual income: ₹12 lakhs
- Basic cover: ₹12L × 15 = ₹1.8 crores
- Two kids: +₹1 crore
- Home loan: +₹60 lakhs
- **Total cover needed: ₹3.4 crores**

## How Long Should Your Policy Last?

**The Question:** Till what age do you need coverage?

**The Answer:** Till your family becomes financially independent.

### Age-Based Analysis

**Age 30:**
- Kids are young (financial dependents)
- Spouse may not earn enough
- Huge liabilities (home loan)
- Minimal savings
- **Coverage needed: 30 years (till age 60)**

**Age 40:**
- Kids still dependent
- Some savings accumulated
- Loans partially paid
- **Coverage needed: 20 years (till age 60)**

**Age 50:**
- Kids in college/working
- Substantial savings
- Loans mostly cleared
- **Coverage needed: 10-15 years (till age 60-65)**

**Age 60+:**
- Kids financially independent
- Retirement corpus ready
- No loans
- **Coverage needed: Minimal or none**

### The Sweet Spot: Age 60-70

**Why stop at 60?**
- Kids are independent
- You have retirement savings
- Spouse has their own corpus
- You're no longer the sole breadwinner

**Why not beyond 70?**
- Average life expectancy in India: 70 years
- Premium becomes very expensive after 70
- Diminishing returns on coverage

**Cost Comparison (₹1 Crore Cover):**

| Policy Term      | Age 30 Premium/Year | Total Paid |
|------------------|---------------------|------------|
| Till age 60 (30y)| ₹12,000             | ₹3,60,000  |
| Till age 65 (35y)| ₹15,000             | ₹5,25,000  |
| Till age 70 (40y)| ₹22,000             | ₹8,80,000  |
| Till age 75 (45y)| ₹38,000             | ₹17,10,000 |

**Notice:** Premium more than doubles for 5 extra years after 70.

**Recommendation:** Policy term till age 60-65 is optimal for most people.

## Life Stage Benefit: Built-In Flexibility

**The Problem:**

You're 25, unmarried, and buy a ₹1 crore term policy. Smart move.

**Five years later:**
- You're married
- You have a kid
- You took a home loan
- Your expenses tripled

Your ₹1 crore cover now looks inadequate. But term insurance is rigid—you can't increase coverage.

**The Solution: Life Stage Benefit**

This rider lets you **increase your cover** during major life events, without fresh medical tests.

### How It Works

**Initial Policy:**
- Age 25
- Cover: ₹1 crore
- Premium: ₹8,000/year

**Life Event 1: Marriage (Age 27)**
- Trigger: Life stage benefit
- Increase cover by: ₹50 lakhs
- New cover: ₹1.5 crores
- New premium: ₹12,000/year

**Life Event 2: First Child (Age 29)**
- Trigger: Life stage benefit
- Increase cover by: ₹50 lakhs
- New cover: ₹2 crores
- New premium: ₹16,000/year

**Life Event 3: Second Child (Age 32)**
- Trigger: Life stage benefit
- Increase cover by: ₹50 lakhs
- New cover: ₹2.5 crores
- New premium: ₹20,000/year

### Allowed Life Events (Typical)

1. Marriage
2. Birth/adoption of child
3. Home loan taken
4. Career milestone (promotion/new job with 50%+ salary hike)

### The Catch

- **No medical tests needed:** Uses your health status from original policy
- **Time limits:** Usually must be exercised within 1 year of life event
- **Maximum increase:** Usually 50% of original sum assured per event
- **Total cap:** Maximum 200% of original sum assured

### Who Needs This?

✅ **Yes, if you're:**
- Unmarried and planning to marry
- Married without kids, planning for kids
- Early in career (income will rise significantly)

❌ **No, if you're:**
- Already married with kids
- Financially settled with appropriate cover
- Willing to buy a new policy later (involves medical tests)

**Cost:** Extra ₹500-₹1,000/year

**Worth it?** Absolutely, if you expect major life changes.

## Waiver of Premium: When You Can't Pay

**The Nightmare Scenario:**

You're 35. Car accident leaves you permanently disabled. You can't work anymore.

Your monthly expenses now include:
- Medical care: ₹20,000
- Regular expenses: ₹50,000
- **Total: ₹70,000/month**

Your income: ₹0

You have a ₹2 crore term insurance policy. Premium: ₹20,000/year.

**The Dilemma:**

Do you keep paying ₹20,000 annual premium when you have no income?

Most people would drop the policy. But that means your family loses the ₹2 crore protection.

### Waiver of Premium Rider

**What It Does:**

If you become **permanently and totally disabled**, the insurance company waives all future premiums. Your policy continues without you paying anything.

**Example:**

Policy: ₹2 crore, 25 years remaining, ₹20,000/year premium

**Year 5:** You become permanently disabled

**What Happens:**
- You paid premium for 5 years: ₹1,00,000
- Insurance company pays premium for next 20 years: ₹4,00,000
- Your ₹2 crore cover continues
- Your family remains protected

**Permanent Disability Criteria:**

Usually requires loss of:
- Both eyes
- Both hands
- Both feet
- One hand and one foot
- Any combination that makes you unable to work

### Critical Illness Version

Some policies offer waiver if you're diagnosed with critical illness:
- Cancer
- Heart attack
- Kidney failure
- Stroke
- Major organ transplant

**Example:**

You're diagnosed with cancer at age 40. You need to quit work for treatment.

**With waiver of premium:**
- Premium waived for remaining policy term
- ₹2 crore cover continues
- One less financial worry during treatment

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Policy Details:**
- Cover: ₹2 crores
- Premium: ₹20,000/year
- Term: 30 years
- Waiver rider cost: ₹1,000/year extra

**Scenario: Disabled at Year 10**

Without waiver:
- Paid for 10 years: ₹2,00,000
- Can't afford remaining 20 years
- Drop policy
- Family loses ₹2 crore protection

With waiver:
- Paid ₹21,000/year for 10 years: ₹2,10,000
- Insurance company pays next 20 years: ₹4,00,000
- Family keeps ₹2 crore protection
- **Net benefit: ₹4,00,000 - ₹10,000 extra paid = ₹3,90,000**

**Recommendation:** Strongly consider this rider, especially if you're the sole breadwinner.

## Accidental Death Benefit: Double Protection

**The Statistic:**

India has one fatal road accident every 4 minutes. That's 360 deaths per day. 1,31,000 deaths per year.

**The Question:**

Should you pay extra for accidental death coverage?

### How It Works

**Base Policy:**
- Cover: ₹2 crores
- Premium: ₹20,000/year

**Add Accidental Death Benefit Rider:**
- Additional cover: ₹1 crore (usually 50% of base)
- Extra premium: ₹1,500/year

**What Happens:**

**Death by natural causes:**
- Payout: ₹2 crores

**Death by accident:**
- Base payout: ₹2 crores
- Accidental rider payout: ₹1 crore
- **Total payout: ₹3 crores**

### What Qualifies as Accident?

✅ **Covered:**
- Road accidents (car, bike, pedestrian)
- Drowning
- Falls
- Fire
- Electrocution
- Natural disasters (earthquake, floods)
- Aviation accidents (as passenger)

❌ **Not Covered:**
- Suicide (intentional)
- Self-inflicted injuries
- Drug/alcohol overdose (intentional)
- While committing crime
- War/nuclear events

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Scenario 1: High-Risk Profession/Commute**

You commute 50 km daily on a highway. Risk is real.

- Extra premium: ₹1,500/year
- Extra cover: ₹1 crore
- **Worth it?** Yes. The extra ₹1 crore provides meaningful additional protection.

**Scenario 2: Low-Risk Lifestyle**

You work from home. Rarely travel. Low accident risk.

- Extra premium: ₹1,500/year
- Probability of accidental death: Low
- **Worth it?** Questionable. Better to increase base cover.

### Better Alternative?

**Instead of:** ₹2 Cr base + ₹1 Cr accident rider = ₹21,500/year

**Consider:** ₹2.5 Cr base cover = ₹23,000/year

The ₹2.5 Cr base cover protects against **all** causes of death, not just accidents. For ₹1,500 more, you get better coverage.

**Recommendation:** Only take accidental death benefit if:
1. You have high accident risk (long commute, high-risk job)
2. You already have maximum base cover you can afford
3. Rider cost is very low (₹1,000/year or less)

**Otherwise:** Increase your base cover instead.

## Critical Illness Rider: Living Benefits

**The Reality:**

You're diagnosed with cancer at age 42. You need immediate treatment.

**The Problem:**

Term insurance only pays if you **die**. But cancer treatment needs to start **now**.

You need:
- ₹15 lakhs for surgery and chemotherapy
- 6 months off work (₹3 lakhs lost income)
- Experimental treatments not covered by health insurance
- **Total: ₹20-25 lakhs**

Your savings: ₹8 lakhs. You're ₹15 lakhs short.

### Critical Illness Rider to the Rescue

**What It Does:**

If you're diagnosed with a critical illness, the insurer pays you a **lump sum immediately**. You're alive and get the money.

**Base Policy:**
- Cover: ₹2 crores (pays on death)
- Premium: ₹20,000/year

**Add Critical Illness Rider:**
- Critical illness cover: ₹50 lakhs
- Extra premium: ₹5,000/year

**Diagnosis: Cancer at Age 42**

What happens:
1. You get diagnosed
2. You submit medical reports
3. Insurance company pays ₹50 lakhs **immediately**
4. Your ₹2 crore term cover reduces to ₹1.5 crores

**Use of ₹50 lakhs:**
- Cancer treatment: ₹20 lakhs
- Income replacement: ₹15 lakhs
- Emergency fund: ₹10 lakhs
- Recovery expenses: ₹5 lakhs

### Which Illnesses Are Covered?

Typically 15-40 critical illnesses, including:

1. **Cancer** (all stages, though some policies exclude early stages)
2. **Heart attack** (first attack, sometimes subsequent ones too)
3. **Stroke** (causing permanent neurological damage)
4. **Kidney failure** (requiring dialysis/transplant)
5. **Major organ transplant** (heart, lung, liver, kidney)
6. **Coronary artery bypass surgery**
7. **Paralysis** (permanent)
8. **Multiple sclerosis**
9. **Blindness** (permanent and irreversible)
10. **Deafness** (permanent and irreversible)
11. **Alzheimer's disease**
12. **Parkinson's disease**
13. **Motor neuron disease**
14. **Coma** (lasting specified period)
15. **Major burns** (covering specified body percentage)

### The Catch: Severity Requirements

Not all cancers or heart conditions qualify. Most policies require:

**Cancer:**
- Must be malignant (not benign)
- Must have spread to other organs
- Early-stage cancers often excluded

**Heart Attack:**
- Must show specific ECG changes
- Must have elevated cardiac enzymes
- Must cause permanent heart damage

**Read the fine print carefully.**

### Impact on Term Cover

**Payout Structure:**

Most policies reduce your death cover by the critical illness amount paid.

**Example:**

Original cover: ₹2 crores
Critical illness cover: ₹50 lakhs
Critical illness diagnosed and ₹50 lakhs paid

**New death cover:** ₹1.5 crores

**If you later die:**
- Family receives: ₹1.5 crores (not ₹2 crores)

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Policy Details:**
- Age: 35
- Base cover: ₹2 crores at ₹20,000/year
- Critical illness rider: ₹50 lakhs at ₹5,000/year extra
- Term: 25 years

**Scenario 1: No Critical Illness**
- Total premium paid: ₹6,25,000 (₹25,000 × 25 years)
- Benefit received: None (you survive)
- Death cover: ₹2 crores maintained

**Scenario 2: Critical Illness at Year 10**
- Premium paid: ₹2,50,000 (₹25,000 × 10 years)
- Benefit received: ₹50 lakhs immediately
- Remaining death cover: ₹1.5 crores

### Should You Buy It?

✅ **Yes, if:**
- Family history of critical illnesses (cancer, heart disease)
- High-stress job (increases heart attack risk)
- You don't have substantial savings (₹20+ lakhs)
- Health insurance has low coverage

❌ **No, if:**
- You have comprehensive health insurance
- Large emergency fund (₹50+ lakhs liquid)
- Premium increase is too high (>30% of base premium)

### Better Alternative: Standalone Critical Illness Policy

Instead of rider, consider standalone critical illness insurance:

**Advantages:**
- Doesn't reduce term cover
- Usually broader illness coverage
- Can be renewed even after term policy expires
- Sometimes cheaper

**Disadvantages:**
- Separate policy to manage
- Separate claim process
- May require fresh medical tests

**Recommendation:** If you can afford it, buy both comprehensive health insurance and a moderate critical illness rider (₹25-50 lakhs). This creates a strong safety net.

## Terminal Illness Rider: The Last Resort

**The Scenario:**

Doctor's diagnosis: Stage 4 cancer. Life expectancy: 6 months.

You want to fight. You want the best treatment—experimental therapy, overseas hospitals, anything that gives you a chance.

Cost: ₹50 lakhs.

Your savings: ₹10 lakhs.

Your term insurance: ₹2 crores. But it only pays **after** you die.

### Terminal Illness Rider

**What It Does:**

If you're diagnosed with a terminal illness (life expectancy < 12 months), the insurer pays your **entire term cover immediately**. While you're alive.

**Your Situation:**
- Term cover: ₹2 crores
- Terminal illness rider: Included
- Diagnosis: Terminal cancer, 6 months to live

**What Happens:**

1. Doctor certifies terminal illness
2. You submit claim with medical reports
3. Insurance company verifies
4. You receive **₹2 crores** immediately
5. You use it for treatment/family needs

**The Beautiful Part:**

Even if you survive beyond 6 months (miracle recovery), the insurer doesn't ask for money back. It's yours.

### Requirements for Claim

1. **Medical certification:** Registered doctor certifies life expectancy < 12 months
2. **Second opinion:** Insurance company may require independent medical assessment
3. **Specific conditions:** Usually limited to:
   - Terminal cancer
   - End-stage organ failure
   - Advanced neurological disorders
   - Other life-threatening conditions

### The Reality Check

**Approval Rates Are Low**

Why?
1. Doctors hesitate to certify "6 months to live" (medical ethics)
2. Insurance companies scrutinize heavily (large payout)
3. "Terminal" is subjective and hard to prove
4. Modern medicine makes prognosis uncertain

**Example:**

You have advanced cancer. Your oncologist says: "Could be 6 months, could be 2 years with treatment. Hard to say."

**Insurance company's response:** Not terminal enough. Claim denied.

### Cost and Trade-offs

**Cost:** Usually ₹500-₹1,500/year extra

**The Catch:** Some policies make this a **full payout**, meaning:
- You get entire ₹2 crores for terminal illness
- Your term cover becomes zero
- If you die, family gets nothing more

**Others offer partial payout:**
- You get ₹50 lakhs for terminal illness
- Death cover reduced to ₹1.5 crores
- Family gets ₹1.5 crores upon death

### Should You Buy It?

**Honest Assessment:**

This rider sounds amazing but has low practical utility.

**Reasons:**
1. Very difficult to qualify (strict criteria)
2. Low approval rates in India
3. When diagnosed terminal, health insurance + savings usually cover treatment
4. Critical illness rider is often more useful (easier to claim)

**Alternative Strategy:**

Instead of terminal illness rider, consider:
1. **Higher critical illness cover:** Easier to claim, broader conditions
2. **Comprehensive health insurance:** Covers treatments without terminal diagnosis
3. **Larger emergency fund:** Accessible immediately without claim process

**Recommendation:** Only add if:
- It's very cheap (₹500/year or less)
- Bundled free with policy
- You have strong family history of terminal conditions

**Otherwise:** Your money is better spent on higher critical illness cover or health insurance.

## Increasing Cover: Inflation Protection

**The Problem:**

You're 30. You buy ₹1 crore term insurance.

Fast forward 15 years. You're 45.

Inflation averaged 6% annually. ₹1 crore 15 years ago equals ₹2.4 crores today in purchasing power.

Your ₹1 crore cover now has the buying power of ₹42 lakhs in today's money.

**Your cover lost 58% of its value to inflation.**

### Solution 1: Increasing Cover Option

**How It Works:**

Your sum assured increases by 5-10% every year automatically.

**Example:**

Year 1: ₹1 crore cover
Year 2: ₹1.05 crores (+5%)
Year 3: ₹1.10 crores (+5%)
...
Year 15: ₹1.98 crores
Year 20: ₹2.53 crores

**The Inflation Fight:**
- Your cover grows 5% per year
- Inflation averages 6% per year
- You almost keep pace with inflation

### The Cost

**Regular Term Insurance:**
- Cover: ₹1 crore (fixed)
- Premium: ₹12,000/year (fixed for entire term)
- Total premium (30 years): ₹3,60,000

**Increasing Cover Term Insurance:**
- Cover: ₹1 crore increasing by 5% per year
- Premium: ₹18,000/year (50-60% higher)
- Total premium (30 years): ₹5,40,000
- **Extra cost: ₹1,80,000**

### The Math: Which Is Better?

**Option A:** Buy ₹1 crore increasing cover
- Premium: ₹18,000/year
- Final cover (Year 30): ₹4.3 crores

**Option B:** Buy ₹2 crore fixed cover
- Premium: ₹20,000/year
- Final cover: ₹2 crores

**Option B is often better** because:
1. Only ₹2,000 more per year
2. You get ₹2 crore cover from Day 1 (not Year 30)
3. Simpler to understand
4. No complexity in premium calculation

### Solution 2: Buy Adequate Cover Upfront

**Smart Approach:**

Calculate cover needed 20 years from now, accounting for inflation.

**Example:**

Current need: ₹1 crore
Inflation: 6% per year
Time horizon: 20 years

Future value of ₹1 crore after 20 years = ₹1 crore × (1.06)^20 = ₹3.2 crores

**Buy ₹3.2 crore cover today.**

**Advantages:**
1. Full protection from Day 1
2. No premium confusion
3. Simpler claim process
4. Usually cheaper than increasing cover

**Cost:**
- ₹3.2 crore cover at age 30: ~₹28,000/year
- Still cheaper than increasing cover option
- Better protection throughout

### Recommendation

**Increasing cover makes sense only if:**
1. You can't afford adequate cover today
2. You're very young (25-30) and expect income to grow significantly
3. Premium increase is minimal (10-20%, not 50-60%)

**For most people:** Calculate your future need, account for inflation, and buy adequate fixed cover today.

## Decreasing Cover: Lower Premium as You Age

**The Logic:**

You're 30. Your financial obligations:
- ₹60 lakh home loan (25 years remaining)
- Two young kids dependent on you
- Spouse may not earn enough
- Minimal savings

**You need: ₹2 crore cover**

**Fast forward to age 50:**
- Home loan: ₹10 lakhs remaining (almost paid off)
- Kids: Financially independent
- Spouse: Has own income/pension
- Savings: ₹60 lakhs accumulated

**You need: Maybe ₹50 lakhs cover**

### Decreasing Cover Option

**How It Works:**

Your sum assured decreases every year. Your premium decreases proportionally.

**Example:**

Year 1: ₹2 crore cover, ₹20,000 premium
Year 5: ₹1.8 crores cover, ₹18,000 premium
Year 10: ₹1.5 crores cover, ₹15,000 premium
Year 15: ₹1.2 crores cover, ₹12,000 premium
Year 20: ₹1 crore cover, ₹10,000 premium

**Total Premium Saved:** Significant over 20 years

### When It Makes Sense

✅ **Good fit if:**
1. You have large loans that decrease over time (home loan EMIs)
2. Kids will become independent in 10-15 years
3. You're systematically building savings/investments
4. You have other income sources developing (rental income, spouse's income)

❌ **Bad fit if:**
1. Financial obligations won't decrease
2. Lifestyle expenses may increase
3. Uncertain about future financial needs
4. You're not aggressively saving

### The Hidden Risk

**Problem:** Life is unpredictable.

**Examples:**

**Scenario 1:**
- Year 15: Your cover decreased to ₹1 crore
- Your daughter wants to pursue MS abroad: ₹50 lakhs needed
- Your elderly parents need expensive medical care
- **₹1 crore suddenly looks inadequate**

**Scenario 2:**
- Year 20: Your cover decreased to ₹80 lakhs
- You took a business loan: ₹40 lakhs
- Medical emergency depleted savings
- **₹80 lakhs won't cover everything**

**You can't reverse the decrease.** Once cover is reduced, it stays reduced.

### Better Alternative: Level Cover + Systematic Investment

**Instead of decreasing cover, try this:**

**Option A: Decreasing Cover**
- Start: ₹2 crore, ₹20,000/year
- Year 20: ₹1 crore, ₹10,000/year
- Average premium saved per year: ₹5,000
- Total saved in 20 years: ₹1,00,000
- **Risk: Under-insured if needs don't decrease**

**Option B: Level Cover + Investment**
- Maintain: ₹2 crore, ₹20,000/year throughout
- Invest in mutual funds/PPF separately
- By Year 20: Your investments cover the gap
- **Benefit: Flexibility + guaranteed cover**

**Why Option B is better:**

If your needs decrease → Your investments cover the gap

If your needs don't decrease → You still have full ₹2 crore cover

### Recommendation

**Decreasing cover sounds logical but is risky in practice.**

**Better approach:**
1. Buy adequate level cover
2. Invest systematically to build your own corpus
3. Your corpus naturally replaces the need for insurance
4. You have flexibility if situations change

**Only consider decreasing cover if:**
- You have a specific decreasing liability (like a home loan)
- You're absolutely certain your needs will decrease
- Premium savings are substantial (30%+ reduction)

## The Term Insurance Checklist

Before buying any term insurance policy, verify:

### Essential Features (Non-Negotiable)

✅ **Sum Assured:** 15-20x your annual income minimum

✅ **Policy Term:** Till age 60-65

✅ **Claim Settlement Ratio:** Insurer should have 95%+ CSR

✅ **Premium:** Fixed (not increasing) throughout policy term

✅ **Death Benefit:** 100% sum assured (no deductions)

✅ **Suicide Clause:** 1 year (not longer)

✅ **Grace Period:** 30 days minimum for premium payment

### Strongly Recommended Riders

✅ **Life Stage Benefit:** If unmarried or no kids yet

✅ **Waiver of Premium:** Especially if sole breadwinner

✅ **Critical Illness:** ₹25-50 lakhs coverage minimum

### Evaluate Case-by-Case

⚠️ **Accidental Death Benefit:** Only if high accident risk or very cheap

⚠️ **Terminal Illness Rider:** Low utility, difficult to claim

⚠️ **Increasing Cover:** Usually better to buy higher fixed cover

⚠️ **Decreasing Cover:** Risky unless certain about decreasing needs

### Red Flags: Walk Away If You See These

❌ **Premium increases over time** (except in increasing cover option)

❌ **Low claim settlement ratio** (<90%)

❌ **Hidden charges** (policy administration fees, etc.)

❌ **Maturity benefits promised** (it's term insurance, there shouldn't be any)

❌ **Investment component** (that's ULIP, not pure term insurance)

❌ **Very limited network** for claim processing

❌ **Pushy sales tactics** ("offer expires today!")

## The Buying Process: Step by Step

### Step 1: Calculate Your Cover

Use the need-based approach:
```
Loans + Future goals + (Annual expenses × Years) - Existing assets = Cover needed
```

### Step 2: Decide Policy Term

Usually till age 60-65, when:
- Kids are independent
- Loans are paid off
- Retirement corpus is ready

### Step 3: Choose Riders

Based on your situation:
- Unmarried? → Life stage benefit
- Sole breadwinner? → Waiver of premium
- Family history of illness? → Critical illness

### Step 4: Compare Insurers

Check:
- **Claim settlement ratio:** IRDAI publishes annual reports
- **Settlement time:** Average days to process claims
- **Customer reviews:** Especially claim experiences
- **Financial stability:** Solvency ratio (should be >1.5)

Top insurers by claim settlement ratio:
1. Max Life (99.35%)
2. HDFC Life (99.03%)
3. ICICI Prudential (98.35%)
4. SBI Life (97.42%)
5. LIC (97.79%)

### Step 5: Apply Online

Advantages:
- 10-15% cheaper than offline
- Faster processing
- Digital policy document
- Easy claim tracking

### Step 6: Medical Tests (If Required)

Usually required if:
- Sum assured > ₹50 lakhs
- Age > 45 years
- Pre-existing medical conditions

Tests typically include:
- Blood pressure
- Blood test (sugar, cholesterol)
- Urine test
- ECG (if over 45)
- BMI measurement

### Step 7: Be Honest About Health

**Critical:** Disclose ALL medical conditions

Examples of what to disclose:
- Diabetes (even controlled)
- Hypertension (even on medication)
- Thyroid disorders
- Asthma
- Previous surgeries
- Family history of critical illness

**Why honesty matters:**
- Insurer has 3 years to investigate fraud
- They will check medical records during claims
- One hidden condition can invalidate entire policy
- Your family loses crores in claims

### Step 8: Review Policy Document

When you receive the policy:
- Check sum assured is correct
- Verify policy term
- Confirm riders included
- Note premium payment dates
- Understand exclusions
- Keep digital and physical copies

### Step 9: Inform Nominee

Tell your nominee:
- Policy exists
- Where policy document is kept
- Insurance company details
- How to file a claim

**Many claims go unclaimed because families don't know about the policy.**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Buying Too Little Cover

**Mistake:** "₹50 lakhs should be enough"

**Reality:** ₹50 lakhs invested at 6% = ₹3 lakhs/year = ₹25,000/month

Can your family survive on ₹25,000/month?

**Fix:** Calculate properly. Aim for 15-20x annual income.

### 2. Delaying Purchase

**At Age 25:** ₹1 crore, 35 years = ₹8,000/year

**At Age 35:** ₹1 crore, 25 years = ₹12,000/year

**At Age 45:** ₹1 crore, 15 years = ₹25,000/year

**You pay 3x more if you wait 20 years.**

Plus, health complications may make you uninsurable.

### 3. Buying from Family/Friends

**Scenario:** Your cousin is an insurance agent. You buy from him without research.

**Problems:**
- May not be the best policy
- Claim settlement ratio ignored
- Expensive riders added
- Difficult to question/change later

**Fix:** Compare multiple insurers. Buy what's best for YOU.

### 4. Mixing Investment and Insurance

**Agent's pitch:** "Why waste money on term insurance? Buy ULIP—you get insurance + returns!"

**Reality:**
- ULIPs have high charges (3-5% of premium)
- Returns are mediocre (6-8%)
- Insurance cover is usually inadequate
- Lock-in period of 5 years

**Better approach:**
- Buy term insurance for protection
- Invest in mutual funds separately

**Example:**

**Option A: ULIP**
- Premium: ₹1,00,000/year
- Insurance cover: ₹10 lakhs
- Expected returns: 8%
- Charges: 3%

**Option B: Term + Mutual Fund**
- Term insurance: ₹2 crores at ₹20,000/year
- Invest remaining ₹80,000 in mutual funds
- Expected returns: 12%
- Charges: 1%

**After 20 years:**

ULIP: ₹10L insurance + ₹40L corpus

Term + MF: ₹2Cr insurance + ₹60L corpus

**Option B wins.**

### 5. Not Reviewing Coverage

**Life changes:**
- Got married → Need more cover
- Had kids → Need more cover
- Took home loan → Need more cover
- Salary doubled → Need more cover

**Fix:** Review term insurance every 3-5 years. Buy additional policy if needed.

### 6. Relying Only on Employer Coverage

**Company provides:** ₹50 lakhs group term insurance

**You think:** "I'm covered!"

**Reality:**
- Coverage ends when you leave job
- Not portable to new company
- Usually inadequate amount
- No control over policy terms

**Fix:** Buy your own term insurance. Treat employer coverage as bonus.

## The Claim Process: What Your Family Needs to Know

### When You Die, Your Nominee Should:

**Step 1: Inform Insurance Company (Within 24-48 hours)**
- Call customer care
- Provide basic details
- Get claim number

**Step 2: Collect Required Documents**
- Death certificate (original + copies)
- Policy document
- Claim form (from insurer)
- Nominee ID proof
- Nominee bank details
- Your ID proof
- Hospital/medical records (if applicable)
- Police report (if accidental/unnatural death)
- Post-mortem report (if unnatural death)

**Step 3: Submit Claim**
- Fill claim form
- Attach all documents
- Submit to nearest branch or online
- Get acknowledgment receipt

**Step 4: Investigation (If Required)**
- Insurer may investigate if:
  - Death within 3 years of policy
  - Unnatural death
  - High sum assured
  - Suspicion of fraud
- Investigation typically takes 30-90 days

**Step 5: Claim Settlement**
- Once approved, amount paid to nominee's bank account
- Usually within 30 days of document submission
- Full sum assured (no deductions)

### Claim Rejection Reasons

1. **Death within 1 year due to suicide**
2. **Death while committing crime**
3. **Fraud/misrepresentation** (hidden medical conditions)
4. **Premium not paid** (policy lapsed)
5. **Death due to excluded cause** (war, nuclear event)
6. **Incomplete documentation**

**Rejection Rate:** 5-7% of claims

**Most rejections are due to fraud/non-disclosure, which is why honesty during application is critical.**

## Final Thoughts: The Best Financial Decision You'll Make

Here's the truth: Term insurance is the only financial product where you pay money and hope you never get it back.

It's the exact opposite of an investment. There's no fancy returns, no maturity benefits, nothing. You pay ₹15,000 every year, and if you survive the policy term, you get ₹0 back.

**And that's exactly why it's brilliant.**

Because the day you don't come home—the day your family needs money the most—that ₹15,000 annual payment becomes ₹2 crores.

Your home loan? Paid.
Your kids' education? Covered.
Your spouse's financial security? Ensured.

**You've been financially replaced.**

For ₹15,000 a year, you've guaranteed your family won't have to choose between grief and bills. They won't have to move to a smaller house. Your kids won't have to drop out of school. Your spouse won't have to panic about money.

That's worth way more than any investment return.

**Here's what to do today:**

1. Calculate your cover (15-20x annual income)
2. Choose policy term (till age 60-65)
3. Add critical riders (life stage, waiver of premium, critical illness)
4. Compare 3-4 insurers (check claim settlement ratio)
5. Buy online (10-15% cheaper)
6. Pay on time, every time

And then hope you never need it. But sleep peacefully knowing your family is protected.
