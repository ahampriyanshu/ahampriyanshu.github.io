## Dividend

A dividend is a distribution of profits by a corporation to its shareholders.[1] When a corporation earns a profit or surplus, it is able to pay a proportion of the profit as a dividend to shareholders. Any amount not distributed is taken to be re-invested in the business (called retained earnings).[^1]
