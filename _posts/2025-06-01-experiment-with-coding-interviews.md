## Culture fit round

Q1. Why are you looking for a new role?

| Do's | Don'ts |
| --- | --- |
| Talk about learning, impact, and alignment with the team's work | Complain about managers, teammates, or compensation only |
| Keep it positive and forward-looking | Sound vague or unfocused |
| Tie your goals to the role and company | Make it about escaping problems |

> I'm looking for a role where I can own end‑to‑end features and learn from a strong engineering culture. I’ve enjoyed my time at my current company, but the scope here aligns better with my interest in shipping customer-facing products and improving reliability.

Q2. What excites you about this role?

| Do's | Don'ts |
| --- | --- |
| Mention specific product/team challenges and how you can help | Give generic answers that fit any company |
| Connect your experience to their stack/process | Over-index on perks or brand |
| Show curiosity about roadmap and users | Oversell skills you don’t have |

> The mix of product development and reliability work excites me. I’ve shipped features in React/Node and improved on-call readiness; this role’s focus on fast iteration with quality is a good match. I’m keen to learn how you prioritize customer feedback in planning.

Q3. What is one area in which you worked better than your colleagues?

| Do's | Don'ts |
| --- | --- |
| Share a concrete example and outcome | Boast without evidence |
| Credit the team and context | Diminish others |
| Focus on behavior you can repeat | Claim you’re the best at everything |

> On a recent launch, I coordinated release checklists and dashboards, which reduced handoffs and caught a config issue pre‑release. The structure helped the team move faster without surprises.

Q4. What is one area in which your colleagues worked better than you?

| Do's | Don'ts |
| --- | --- |
| Be honest; pick something real and relevant | Say “I have no weaknesses” |
| Share how you learned from them | Blame process or people |
| Describe a change you adopted | Leave it without a plan |

> A teammate was excellent at writing small, reviewable PRs. I adopted their approach—feature flags and incremental PRs—and it improved my review times and reduced merge conflicts.

Q5. Tell me about a time when you had to work with a difficult colleague/manager.

| Do's | Don'ts |
| --- | --- |
| Describe the behavior, not the person | Vent or label people |
| Show how you aligned on goals and constraints | Escalate without trying to resolve |
| Share the outcome and what changed | Hide trade‑offs |

> A stakeholder pushed scope late in the sprint. I reframed the goal, proposed a phased plan, and clarified timelines. We shipped a minimal version on time and scheduled the rest with explicit acceptance criteria.

Q6. What is one time when you went above and beyond for a release/client/customer?

| Do's | Don'ts |
| --- | --- |
| Show ownership across build, test, deploy, and follow‑up | Focus only on hours worked |
| Quantify impact if possible | Make it a hero story with no lessons |
| Include what you automated afterward | Ignore sustainability |

> During a critical release, I added runtime checks and a rollback plan, stayed on to monitor, and wrote a runbook after. Alert noise dropped, and the checklist became part of our standard release process.

Q7. What is one time when you went above and beyond for a client/customer?

| Do's | Don'ts |
| --- | --- |
| Center the customer problem and outcome | Talk only about internal tooling |
| Show empathy and proactive communication | Surprise customers with silent fixes |
| Close the loop with learnings | Overpromise |

> A customer reported slow exports before a renewal. I profiled the path, shipped a pagination fix, and kept them updated. Exports sped up 4× and they renewed; we later added SLOs to track this path.

Q8. What was your biggest success or failure in your previous role?

| Do's | Don'ts |
| --- | --- |
| Pick one story; define success/failure clearly | Ramble through many examples |
| Share metrics and lessons | Take sole credit or place blame |
| Explain what you changed after | Leave no takeaways |

> Success: I led a refactor that cut build times by 40%, unblocking releases. Failure: I underestimated a migration’s risk; after a rollback, I added a shadow‑read phase and improved our canary checks. Both changed how I plan migrations.

Q9. When you work on a new feature, when does your responsibility end?

| Do's | Don'ts |
| --- | --- |
| Include testing, docs, rollout, monitoring, and support | Stop at “PR merged” |
| Mention telemetry and feedback loops | Ignore handover and on‑call |
| Define “done” with clear criteria | Be vague |

> My responsibility ends when the feature delivers value safely: tests pass, docs exist, metrics and alerts are in place, rollout is complete, and we’ve addressed early feedback. I also ensure a runbook/on‑call context is updated.

Q10. What is your biggest strength and weakness?

| Do's | Don'ts |
| --- | --- |
| Choose a strength relevant to the role | List every possible strength |
| Share a real weakness with mitigation | Give a fake weakness |
| Provide examples | Stay abstract |

> Strength: structured problem‑solving under time pressure; I break work into safe increments. Weakness: I can over‑edit PRs; I now use time‑boxed reviews and focus on correctness and clarity first.

Q11. What do you do when you are stuck on a problem?/What do you do when you are not able to solve a problem?

| Do's | Don'ts |
| --- | --- |
| Explain a repeatable debugging approach | Say “I just try harder” |
| Mention logs, repros, bisecting, and asking for help | Spin without a plan |
| Show when you escalate | Escalate too late |

> I create a minimal repro, check logs/metrics, and bisect to isolate the change. If blocked, I pair or ask in the channel with context. I time‑box, document findings, and escalate early with options.

Q12. What sort of challenges do you enjoy the most?

| Do's | Don'ts |
| --- | --- |
| Align with the role’s problems | Give unrelated examples |
| Mention impact on users/teams | Focus only on tech for tech’s sake |
| Show curiosity and learning | Sound rigid |

> I enjoy problems at the boundary of product and reliability—shipping features that scale and are observable. I like simplifying complex flows so customers see faster value.

Q13. What sort of challenges do you enjoy the least?

| Do's | Don'ts |
| --- | --- |
| Be honest but professional | Complain about necessary work |
| Show how you handle them anyway | Refuse critical tasks |
| Offer a coping strategy | Sound inflexible |

> I enjoy most work. The least enjoyable is unplanned, repeated toil; I handle it, then look for automation or process fixes so it doesn’t recur.

Q14. Your happiest moment/saddest moment in your previous role?

| Do's | Don'ts |
| --- | --- |
| Tie emotions to impact and learning | Make it personal gossip |
| Keep it respectful | Name‑and‑shame |
| Share what changed afterward | Leave it flat |

> Happiest: seeing customers use a feature we built end‑to‑end. Saddest: a missed incident alert that impacted users; I helped improve alert routes and on‑call training.

Q15. When was the last time you broke something in production? How did you tackle it?

| Do's | Don'ts |
| --- | --- |
| Own the mistake and the fix | Hide or minimize |
| Describe detection, mitigation, and prevention | Focus only on the fix |
| Mention communication | Ignore stakeholders |

> I introduced a caching bug that returned stale data. We rolled back, added a cache‑busting header, and I wrote a regression test and a pre‑deploy checklist item. I posted a brief RCA and follow‑ups.

Q16. What is your biggest strength and weakness?

| Do's | Don'ts |
| --- | --- |
| Provide a different lens from Q10 | Repeat the same story verbatim |
| Show growth over time | Be static |
| Map to team value | List platitudes |

> Strength: clear communication across teams; I write concise RFCs and run effective handoffs. Weakness: I can over‑participate in discussions; I now set agendas and time‑boxes to keep meetings focused.

Q17. What is customer satisfaction for you?

| Do's | Don'ts |
| --- | --- |
| Define it in outcomes and behaviors | Reduce it to a metric only |
| Mention reliability, usability, and support | Ignore qualitative feedback |
| Show how you measure and act | Treat it as a one‑off |

> Customers are satisfied when they achieve their goal quickly and reliably. I look at task completion time, error rates, and feedback, and I feed that into the backlog.

Q18. Have you viewed our company's website/app/product?

| Do's | Don'ts |
| --- | --- |
| Share specific observations and questions | Say “not yet” |
| Be respectful and curious | Nitpick tone‑deafly |
| Link your skills to improvements | Make assumptions |

> Yes. I like the onboarding flow and the docs are clear. I’d be curious about your analytics on drop‑off at step two; I could help experiment with faster load times there.

Q19. What is your biggest strength and weakness?

| Do's | Don'ts |
| --- | --- |
| Keep it concise and additive to Q10/Q16 | Contradict earlier answers |
| Tie to the role’s day‑to‑day | Rehash unrelated traits |
| Include an example | Stay generic |

> Strength: bias for small, safe iterations; it helps ship reliably. Weakness: I used to under‑document; I now write short ADRs and update runbooks as part of “done.”
