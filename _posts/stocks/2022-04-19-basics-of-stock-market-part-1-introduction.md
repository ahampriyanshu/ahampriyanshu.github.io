## Myths about stock markets

* Investing is gambling.
* You can loose all of your money.
* Large capital is required.
* Stocks that plummet must go back up.
* High risk equates to high profits.
* Only meant for "experts".

## Dividend

A dividend is a distribution of profits by a corporation to its shareholders.[1] When a corporation earns a profit or surplus, it is able to pay a proportion of the profit as a dividend to shareholders. Any amount not distributed is taken to be re-invested in the business (called retained earnings).[^1]
