Below is my interpretation of your query "readme doc out of this." Based on the conversation history, I'm assuming you're referring to the most recent item—the 90-day plan I provided for improving your spoken English (focusing on accent, grammar, and phrases). It seems like you're asking me to create a "README" document out of it, similar to a README.md file commonly used in projects (e.g., on GitHub) to outline instructions, structure, and usage in a clear, formatted way.

I've formatted this as a self-contained README.md-style document in Markdown. You can copy-paste it into a file (e.g., `EnglishImprovementPlan README.md`) for easy reference, printing, or sharing. It includes the full plan, with added sections for quick navigation, resources, and tracking tips to make it more like a project guide. If this isn't what you meant (e.g., if it's a typo for something else like "ready doc" or "read me doc"), feel free to clarify!

# English Improvement Plan: 90-Day Spoken English Mastery

## Overview
This 90-day plan is designed for Indian speakers aiming to refine their English accent, strengthen grammar, and incorporate useful phrases for personal and professional life. It's based on proven language-learning methods, emphasizing daily practice (30-60 minutes) for consistent progress. The plan is divided into three phases: Foundation Building, Confidence Boost, and Fluency and Polish.

**Goals:**
- **Accent:** Improve pronunciation, intonation, and sounds (e.g., vowels like "th" or short vowels influenced by Hindi).
- **Grammar:** Build accurate sentence structures for clearer communication.
- **Phrases:** Add idiomatic expressions for natural, confident conversations (e.g., "Break a leg!" for personal chats or "Touch base" in professional settings).

**Expected Outcomes:** By day 90, you'll speak with greater clarity, fewer errors, and more fluency in real-life scenarios.

**Duration:** 90 days (start today: Monday, July 28, 2025).  
**Commitment:** 30-60 minutes daily. Track progress in a journal or app.  
**Prerequisites:** Basic English knowledge; access to a smartphone/computer for audio/resources.

## Getting Started
1. **Set Up Your Tools:**
   - Recording app (e.g., Voice Recorder on phone) for self-assessments.
   - Language apps: Duolingo, HelloTalk (for partners), or ELSA Speak (for accent feedback).
   - Resources: YouTube (search "BBC Learning English" or "Rachel's English" for accent videos), podcasts (e.g., "6 Minute English"), and free IPA charts.
   - Journal: Note daily wins, challenges, and new phrases.

2. **Tips for Success:**
   - Practice consistently—even 10 minutes beats skipping a day.
   - Speak slowly at first; speed up as you improve.
   - Seek feedback: Share recordings with friends or online communities (e.g., Reddit's r/languagelearning).
   - Adjust as needed: If a phase feels too easy/hard, tweak the time or focus.

## Phase 1: Foundation Building (Days 1-30)
Focus on basics: Accent awareness, simple grammar, and everyday phrases. Build habits through listening and repetition.

### Daily Routine (30-40 minutes)
- **10 minutes: Accent Warm-Up** – Mouth exercises (e.g., exaggerate "ee" and "ah" sounds). Shadow native speakers on YouTube (mimic rhythm/tone).
- **10 minutes: Grammar Drill** – Study one rule (e.g., present tense). Practice 5 sentences aloud; record and check.
- **10 minutes: Phrase Integration** – Learn 3-5 new phrases. Use in sentences (e.g., Personal: "I'm on cloud nine" – very happy).
- **10 minutes: Speaking Practice** – Narrate your day in English, speaking slowly.

### Weekly Focus
- **Week 1:** Basic introductions/greetings (e.g., "How's it going?").
- **Week 2:** Simple grammar (articles: a/an/the); personal phrases (e.g., "Once in a blue moon" – rare events).
- **Week 3:** Accent on vowels; professional phrases (e.g., "Get the ball rolling" – start something).
- **Week 4:** Review—Record and compare to native audio.

### Progress Check (Day 30)
Chat with a language partner (e.g., via HelloTalk) for 10 minutes. Journal improvements.

## Phase 2: Confidence Boost (Days 31-60)

- **15 minutes: Phrase Expansion** – Add 5-7 phrases (e.g., Professional: "Touch base" – check in briefly; "Think outside the box" – be creative).
- **15 minutes: Role-Play** – Simulate scenarios (e.g., ordering food or a team meeting).

### Weekly Focus
- **Week 5:** Hobbies/opinions (e.g., "I see your point" – agree partially).
- **Week 6:** Grammar for descriptions (adjectives/adverbs); personal phrases (e.g., "Hit the nail on the head" – exactly right).
- **Week 7:** Accent on consonants; professional idioms (e.g., "Go the extra mile" – do more than needed).
- **Week 8:** Travel/daily routines, mixing elements.

### Progress Check (Day 60)
Record a 2-minute self-introduction video. Share online for feedback; aim for smoother accent/grammar.

Refine for natural flow: Complex grammar, advanced phrases, and accent in longer interactions.

### Daily Routine (45-60 minutes)
