## 2. Number of 1 Bits

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the ``Hamming weight``).

**Note:**

* Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.

* In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 3, the input represents the signed integer.

* [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/)

### Naive

```cpp
int setBits(int N) {
    
    int count = 0;
    while(N){
      count += (N & 1);
      N = N >> 1;
    }
  return count;
}
```

### Brian Kernighanâ€™s Algorithm

```cpp
int setBits(int N) {
    int count = 0;
    while (N) {
      N &= (N - 1);
      count++;
    }
  return count;
}
```

### STL

```cpp
int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
  return __builtin_popcount(n);
}
```

### Converting to string

```cpp
int hammingWeight(uint32_t n){

  string bin = bitset<32>(n).to_string(); 
  int counter = count(bin.begin(), bin.end(), '1');
  return counter;

}
```
