## 🤖 Machine Learning Fundamentals

### Understanding Machine Learning Paradigms

**Machine Learning** encompasses various approaches to building systems that learn patterns from data. At its core, it's about creating **models** - mathematical approximations of relationships between inputs and outputs.

#### Supervised Learning

**Supervised learning** focuses on optimizing models using previously observed features paired with known labels. The primary goal is predicting the most likely label for new, unseen features.

```python
# Basic supervised learning workflow
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Split data into features (X) and labels (y)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
```

#### Unsupervised Learning

**Unsupervised learning** takes a different approach, working with unlabeled data to discover hidden patterns and structures. The goal is uncovering previously unknown insights from the data itself.

#### Deep Learning

**Deep learning** represents a specialized branch focusing on neural networks with multiple hidden layers. These systems can perform both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks with remarkable effectiveness.

### Core ML Concepts

#### Features and Labels

**Features** represent measurable properties or characteristics describing observations. They come in various forms:
- **Binary**: "day" vs "night"
- **Categorical**: "morning", "afternoon", "evening"  
- **Continuous**: numerical values like 3.141
- **Ordinal**: ordered categories like "threatened", "endangered", "extinct"

**Labels** are typically paired with features in supervised learning and can be either discrete (categories) or continuous (numerical values).

**Examples** consist of feature-label pairs used for training and evaluation.

#### Mathematical Foundations

**Vectors** represent feature collections as lists of values describing particular examples.

**Matrices** organize data as arrays with multiple rows and columns, while **matrix transpose** operations flip matrices over their diagonals.

**Dimensions** refer to the number of features associated with each example.

```python
import numpy as np

# Example feature vector
feature_vector = np.array([1.2, 0.8, 2.1, 0.5])

# Matrix representation
data_matrix = np.array([
    [1.2, 0.8, 2.1, 0.5],  # Example 1
    [0.9, 1.1, 1.8, 0.7],  # Example 2
    [1.5, 0.6, 2.3, 0.4]   # Example 3
])

# Matrix transpose
transposed = data_matrix.T
print(f"Original shape: {data_matrix.shape}")
print(f"Transposed shape: {transposed.shape}")
```

#### Probability and Statistics

**Probability** quantifies how likely events are to occur, whether independent (like dice rolls) or conditional (like drawing cards without replacement).

**Probability distributions** are functions that map outcomes to their occurrence probabilities.

**Gaussian (Normal) distributions** fit many real-world observations and appear frequently in machine learning applications.

**Uniform distributions** assign equal probability to all possible outcomes.

## 📊 Supervised Learning Algorithms

### Naive Bayes Classification

**Naive Bayes** algorithms provide probabilistic classification based on Bayes' theorem. Despite their "naive" assumption of feature independence, they often perform surprisingly well in practice.

#### Core Components

**Prior probability** represents the likelihood of a particular class regardless of feature values.

**Likelihood** calculates the probability of observing certain features given a specific class.

**Posterior probability** combines prior and likelihood to determine the probability of a class given observed features.

**Evidence** serves as the normalizing denominator in Bayes' theorem.

```python
# Naive Bayes implementation example
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

# Text classification example
texts = ["I love this movie", "This film is terrible", "Great acting here"]
labels = ["positive", "negative", "positive"]

# Vectorize text
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(texts)

# Train Naive Bayes
nb_model = MultinomialNB()
nb_model.fit(X, labels)

# Predict new text
new_text = ["This movie is amazing"]
new_X = vectorizer.transform(new_text)
prediction = nb_model.predict(new_X)
```

#### Text Processing Techniques

**Tokenization** splits raw text into individual words or elements.

**Featurization** transforms raw inputs into formats suitable for model training and prediction.

**Vectorizers** convert tokenized text into numerical representations. Binary vectorizers create vectors indicating vocabulary word presence.

**Stop words** are commonly removed words that add little predictive value.

**Stemming** removes word endings to find root forms, while **lemmatization** provides a more sophisticated approach ensuring proper root words result.

**Bernoulli distribution** models binary outcomes, useful in text classification where words are either present or absent.

**Laplace smoothing** prevents zero probability issues by adding small values to all counts.

#### Advanced Text Features

**TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** transforms word counts into importance scores across document collections.

**N-grams** capture sequences of adjacent words of length n, preserving word order information.

**Feature hashing** represents text as hash results modded by predetermined values, enabling efficient storage.

### Performance Evaluation

#### Classification Metrics

Understanding model performance requires sophisticated evaluation techniques beyond simple accuracy.

**Accuracy** measures the ratio of correct predictions to total predictions:
```
Accuracy = (True Positives + True Negatives) / Total Examples
```

**Confusion matrices** provide detailed breakdowns of prediction performance in 2x2 grids showing true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create confusion matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, predictions)

# Visualize confusion matrix
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.ylabel('Actual')
plt.xlabel('Predicted')
plt.show()

# Detailed classification report
print(classification_report(y_test, predictions))
```

**Sensitivity (Recall)** measures the proportion of actual positives correctly identified.

**Specificity** calculates the proportion of actual negatives correctly identified.

**Precision** determines the accuracy of positive predictions:
```
Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
```

**F1 Score** provides the harmonic mean of precision and recall, offering a balanced metric.

#### Advanced Evaluation

**ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves** plot sensitivity vs specificity across different decision thresholds.

**AUC (Area Under Curve)** represents the probability that a randomly chosen positive example scores higher than a randomly chosen negative example.

**Decision points** (thresholds) determine classification cutoffs - values above predict one class, below predict another.

#### Model Validation

**Validation** involves holding out data portions for testing separate from training sets.

**Generalization** measures a model's ability to perform well on unseen data beyond the test set.

**Unbalanced classes** occur when one class appears much more frequently than others, requiring special handling techniques.

### K-Nearest Neighbors

**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifies examples based on the majority class among the k closest training examples.

#### Distance Metrics

Different distance measures suit different data types:

**Euclidean distance** calculates straight-line distances between points in feature space.

**Manhattan distance** sums absolute differences across all features.

**Jaccard distance** handles binary features by comparing matching values while excluding matching zeros.

**Simple matching distance** considers all matching binary values including zeros.

**Hamming distance** counts non-matching categorical feature values.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.spatial.distance import euclidean, manhattan, hamming

# Example distance calculations
point1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
point2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

euclidean_dist = euclidean(point1, point2)
manhattan_dist = manhattan(point1, point2)

print(f"Euclidean distance: {euclidean_dist:.2f}")
print(f"Manhattan distance: {manhattan_dist:.2f}")
```

#### Feature Scaling

**Feature normalization** scales values between 0 and 1, ensuring all features contribute equally.

**Feature standardization** centers features around their mean and scales by standard deviation.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler

# Normalization (0-1 scaling)
normalizer = MinMaxScaler()
X_normalized = normalizer.fit_transform(X)

# Standardization (mean=0, std=1)
standardizer = StandardScaler()
X_standardized = standardizer.fit_transform(X)
```

### Decision Trees

**Decision trees** create tree-based models that route examples to leaf nodes based on feature properties.

#### Tree Construction

**CART (Classification and Regression Trees)** algorithms construct approximately optimal decision trees for given datasets.

**Split points** consist of feature-value pairs determining how examples flow through tree nodes.

**Gini impurity** measures node impurity for classification trees, helping identify optimal split points based on classification error probability.

**Mean squared error** serves as the splitting criterion for regression trees.

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier, plot_tree
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Train decision tree
tree_model = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3, random_state=42)
tree_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Visualize tree
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 10))
plot_tree(tree_model, feature_names=feature_names, 
          class_names=class_names, filled=True)
plt.show()
```

#### Handling Missing Data

**Missing data** occurs when feature values are unavailable for some examples.

**Surrogate splits** provide backup split criteria for examples missing optimal split features.

#### Ensemble Methods

**Ensemble** techniques combine multiple models for improved performance.

**Boosting** trains weak learners sequentially, with each learning from previous errors, typically reducing bias.

**Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregation)** trains models on data subsets, generally reducing variance.

**Random Forest** combines many independent weak learners to reduce variance.

**Weak learners** are typically shallow decision trees or other underfitting models.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier

# Random Forest
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Gradient Boosting
gb_model = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
gb_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Feature importance
feature_importance = rf_model.feature_importances_
```

**XGBoost** and **LightGBM** provide optimized gradient boosting frameworks with enhanced performance and efficiency.

### Linear Regression

**Linear regression** finds the **line of best fit** describing relationships between dependent and independent variables.

#### Statistical Concepts

**Correlation** measures relationships between dependent and independent variables.

**R-squared (coefficient of determination)** indicates the percentage of variance explained by independent variables.

**Residuals** represent distances between actual data points and the fitted line.

**P-values** show the probability of obtaining results given a null hypothesis.

**Confidence intervals** provide ranges for unknown values with specified probability levels.

```python
import statsmodels.api as sm
import numpy as np

# Linear regression with statsmodels
X_with_intercept = sm.add_constant(X)  # Add intercept term
model = sm.OLS(y, X_with_intercept)
results = model.fit()

# Display detailed statistics
print(results.summary())

# Extract key metrics
r_squared = results.rsquared
p_values = results.pvalues
confidence_intervals = results.conf_int()
```

#### Advanced Regression Concepts

**Independent variables** have variation independent from other variables.

**Dependent variables** have variation depending on other variables.

**One-hot encoding** represents categorical variables as binary vectors.

**Multicollinearity** occurs when independent variables aren't actually independent.

**Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)** measures multicollinearity levels.

**Feature interactions** multiply features together to express relationships not captured by simple addition.

**Nonlinear regression** models non-linear relationships in independent variables.

**Simpson's Paradox** describes patterns emerging in data segments that disappear when segments are combined.

### Logistic Regression

**Logistic regression** extends linear concepts to classification problems with limited outcome numbers.

#### Core Components

**Sigmoid function** (logistic function) transforms any real number to a value between 0 and 1, perfect for probability estimation.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

# Plot sigmoid function
x = np.linspace(-10, 10, 100)
y = sigmoid(x)

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title('Sigmoid Function')
plt.xlabel('Input')
plt.ylabel('Output')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

**Cross-entropy loss** serves as the optimization objective for classification tasks, measuring differences between predicted and true label distributions.

#### Training Process

Unlike linear regression's **closed-form solution**, logistic regression requires iterative optimization.

**Gradient descent** optimizes parameters through iterative updates using loss function gradients.

**Learning rate** controls update step sizes during parameter optimization.

**Parameters** (weights/coefficients) are learned during training.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import log_loss

# Logistic regression implementation
log_reg = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
log_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Probability predictions
probabilities = log_reg.predict_proba(X_test)
predictions = log_reg.predict(X_test)

# Calculate cross-entropy loss
loss = log_loss(y_test, probabilities)
print(f"Cross-entropy loss: {loss:.4f}")
```

#### Advanced Concepts

**Odds ratios** measure association degrees between events. Values of 1 indicate independence, greater than 1 indicate positive correlation, less than 1 indicate negative correlation.

**Multinomial logistic regression** extends binary classification to multiple classes.

**Softmax** generalizes sigmoid functions for multi-class scenarios.

#### Training Optimization

**Epochs** represent complete training cycles through all examples.

**Gradient descent variants**:
- **Batch**: Uses all examples per iteration
- **Mini-batch**: Uses example subsets per iteration  
- **Stochastic**: Uses single examples per iteration

**Regularization** prevents overfitting by encouraging smaller parameter values.

**Early stopping** halts training before reaching optima to prevent overfitting.

#### Class Imbalance Handling

**Downsampling** removes majority class examples.

**Upweighting** increases minority class impact on loss functions.

**McFadden's Pseudo R-squared** provides an analog to linear regression's R-squared for logistic models.

#### Model Types

**Generative models** approximate joint probability distributions of features and labels.

**Discriminative models** approximate conditional probability distributions of labels given features.

### Support Vector Machines

**Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** find optimal decision boundaries by maximizing margins between classes.

#### Core Concepts

**Support vectors** are the most difficult-to-separate points that influence decision boundary placement.

**Margins** represent spaces between hyperplanes and support vectors.

**Hyperplanes** serve as decision boundaries in any dimension.

**Norms** (specifically L2 norm) calculate vector magnitudes as square roots of squared element sums.

```python
from sklearn.svm import SVC
import numpy as np

# SVM implementation
svm_model = SVC(kernel='rbf', C=1.0, gamma='scale')
svm_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Get support vectors
support_vectors = svm_model.support_vectors_
n_support = svm_model.n_support_

print(f"Number of support vectors: {len(support_vectors)}")
print(f"Support vectors per class: {n_support}")
```

#### Soft Margin SVMs

**Outliers** significantly vary from other features and can disrupt decision boundaries.

**Slack** allows relaxation of margin constraints, creating soft-margin SVMs.

**Hinge loss** functions are used by soft-margin SVMs for optimization.

#### Advanced Topics

**Sub-gradients** handle gradients of non-differentiable functions.

**Non-differentiable functions** have points where derivatives are undefined.

**Convex functions** have single optima, ensuring global optimization.

**Kernel trick** enables high-dimensional computations without explicit high-dimensional representations. **Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels** are commonly used.

## 🔍 Unsupervised Learning

### K-Means Clustering

**K-means clustering** partitions data into k clusters by minimizing within-cluster distances.

#### Algorithm Components

**Centroids** represent cluster centers in n-dimensional space.

**Inertia** measures total distances between points and their assigned centroids.

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# K-means implementation
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
cluster_labels = kmeans.fit_predict(X)
centroids = kmeans.cluster_centers_

# Visualize clusters (for 2D data)
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
scatter = plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=cluster_labels, cmap='viridis')
plt.scatter(centroids[:, 0], centroids[:, 1], 
           marker='x', s=300, c='red', linewidth=3)
plt.title('K-Means Clustering')
plt.colorbar(scatter)
plt.show()
```

#### Optimization Challenges

**Local optima** represent suboptimal solutions in non-convex optimization landscapes.

**Non-convex functions** have multiple zero-slope instances, making global optimization challenging.

#### Choosing Optimal K

**Elbow method** identifies optimal k values by finding plot elbows in k vs inertia graphs.

**Silhouette method** considers inter-cluster and intra-cluster distance ratios for k selection.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score

# Elbow method
inertias = []
silhouette_scores = []
k_range = range(2, 11)

for k in k_range:
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=42)
    cluster_labels = kmeans.fit_predict(X)
    inertias.append(kmeans.inertia_)
    silhouette_scores.append(silhouette_score(X, cluster_labels))

# Plot results
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(15, 5))

ax1.plot(k_range, inertias, 'bo-')
ax1.set_title('Elbow Method')
ax1.set_xlabel('Number of Clusters (k)')
ax1.set_ylabel('Inertia')

ax2.plot(k_range, silhouette_scores, 'ro-')
ax2.set_title('Silhouette Method')
ax2.set_xlabel('Number of Clusters (k)')
ax2.set_ylabel('Silhouette Score')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

#### Advanced Clustering

**K-means++** uses weighted probability distributions for better initial centroid placement.

**Agglomerative clustering** builds cluster hierarchies from bottom-up, gradually grouping subclusters.

### Dimensionality Reduction

#### Singular Value Decomposition

**Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** decomposes matrices into rotation and scaling components, generalizing eigendecomposition.

**Rank r approximation** uses up to the rth terms in SVD to approximate original matrices.

**Dimensionality reduction** decreases feature numbers to speed up training and enable broader algorithm applicability.

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA, TruncatedSVD
import numpy as np

# SVD for dimensionality reduction
svd = TruncatedSVD(n_components=2, random_state=42)
X_reduced = svd.fit_transform(X)

# Explained variance ratio
explained_variance = svd.explained_variance_ratio_
print(f"Explained variance: {explained_variance}")
print(f"Total explained variance: {np.sum(explained_variance):.3f}")
```

#### Principal Component Analysis

**Eigendecomposition** factors square matrices into eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** performs eigendecomposition on data covariance matrices. Eigenvectors describe principal components while eigenvalues indicate variance explained by each component.

**Orthogonal** components are perpendicular in n-dimensional space.

```python
# PCA implementation
pca = PCA(n_components=0.95)  # Keep 95% of variance
X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X)

# Analyze components
components = pca.components_
explained_variance_ratio = pca.explained_variance_ratio_

print(f"Original dimensions: {X.shape[1]}")
print(f"Reduced dimensions: {X_pca.shape[1]}")
print(f"Explained variance per component: {explained_variance_ratio}")
```

## 🧠 Deep Learning

### Neural Network Fundamentals

**Neural networks** consist of interconnected **neurons** (perceptrons) that process information through layers.

#### Network Architecture

**Hidden layers** exist between input and output layers in neural networks.

**Fully connected (dense) layers** connect every neuron to every neuron in subsequent layers.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout

# Simple neural network
model = Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_dim,)),
    Dropout(0.2),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.2),
    Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train,
                   epochs=100,
                   batch_size=32,
                   validation_split=0.2,
                   verbose=1)
```

#### Training Process

**Forward pass** calculates network outputs for given inputs.

**Backpropagation** uses the chain rule and dynamic programming to compute loss function gradients.

**Gradients** are vectors of partial derivatives used to update network parameters.

#### Optimization Challenges

**Vanishing gradients** occur when repeated small gradient multiplications result in near-zero values.

**Exploding gradients** happen when repeated large gradient multiplications cause overflow.

**Initialization techniques** (Kaiming, Xavier/Glorot) cleverly set initial weights to avoid gradient problems.

#### Activation Functions

**Activation functions** transform neuron outputs and can be linear or nonlinear.

**Rectified Linear Units (ReLU)** output positive inputs unchanged and zero otherwise.

**Hyperbolic tangent** provides symmetric activation ranging from -1 to 1.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def relu(x):
    return np.maximum(0, x)

def tanh(x):
    return np.tanh(x)

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

# Plot activation functions
x = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)

fig, (ax1, ax2, ax3) = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(15, 4))

ax1.plot(x, relu(x))
ax1.set_title('ReLU')
ax1.grid(True)

ax2.plot(x, tanh(x))
ax2.set_title('Tanh')
ax2.grid(True)

ax3.plot(x, sigmoid(x))
ax3.set_title('Sigmoid')
ax3.grid(True)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

#### Optimization Algorithms

**Momentum** incorporates previous gradients into current weight updates.

**Adagrad** applies different learning rates to different weights.

**Adam** combines momentum and adaptive learning rates for efficient optimization.

#### Regularization Techniques

**Dropout** randomly omits neurons during training to prevent overfitting.

**Pruning** removes neurons to reduce model parameters while maintaining performance.

### Convolutional Neural Networks

**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** excel at processing grid-like data such as images.

#### Convolution Operations

**Image kernels** are arrays applied to images for filtering effects.

**Convolutional layers** connect neurons to subset regions rather than fully connected patterns.

**Receptive fields** define the number of preceding layer neurons connected to subsequent layer neurons.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten

# CNN architecture
cnn_model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

cnn_model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                 loss='categorical_crossentropy',
                 metrics=['accuracy'])
```

#### CNN Components

**Stride** determines incremental rates for kernel application to images.

**Feature maps** result from applying kernels to images or other feature maps.

**Channels** represent stacked images (RGB) or feature map numbers from convolutional layers.

**Pooling** (max or average) reduces spatial dimensions while retaining important information.

**Image padding** adds zero-valued borders to maintain image dimensions after convolution.

**Shift invariance** enables object recognition regardless of position within images.

**Flatten layers** convert stacked feature maps into single feature vectors for dense layers.

#### Advanced Techniques

**Batch normalization** normalizes layer inputs by re-centering and re-scaling to accelerate learning.

**Pre-trained models** leverage existing trained networks as starting points for new tasks.

### Recurrent Neural Networks

**Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** excel at sequential data by routing outputs back as inputs.

#### RNN Architecture

**Hidden states** represent RNN outputs from previous timesteps.

**Cell states** provide additional memory in Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, GRU, Embedding

# RNN for sequence classification
rnn_model = Sequential([
    Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, input_length=max_length),
    LSTM(128, dropout=0.2, recurrent_dropout=0.2),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

rnn_model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                 loss='binary_crossentropy',
                 metrics=['accuracy'])
```

#### Advanced RNN Types

**Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks use cell states, hidden states, and three gates (input, forget, output) to manage information flow.

**Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)** simplify LSTMs with hidden states and two gates (update, reset).

**Embedding layers** transform discrete inputs into dense vector representations optimized during training.

#### Training Considerations

**Backpropagation Through Time** extends standard backpropagation to sequential data with additional partial derivatives per timestep.

**Gradient clipping** caps gradient values to prevent exploding gradients in RNNs.

### Generative Adversarial Networks

**Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** employ adversarial training between generator and discriminator networks.

#### GAN Architecture

Generators create fake data to minimize loss functions while discriminators identify fake data to maximize different loss functions.

**Mode collapse** occurs when generators exploit discriminator weaknesses by producing limited data varieties.

```python
# Simple GAN structure (conceptual)
def build_generator():
    model = Sequential([
        Dense(128, activation='relu', input_dim=noise_dim),
        Dense(256, activation='relu'),
        Dense(512, activation='relu'),
        Dense(784, activation='tanh')  # 28x28 image
    ])
    return model

def build_discriminator():
    model = Sequential([
        Dense(512, activation='relu', input_dim=784),
        Dense(256, activation='relu'),
        Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])
    return model
```

## 🎯 Specialized Applications

### Recommendation Systems

**Recommendation systems** present items to users with high likelihood of purchase, viewing, or approval.

#### Recommendation Approaches

**Content filtering** considers single user features alongside many item features.

**Collaborative filtering** leverages multiple users' and items' data through user-item matrices.

**User-item matrices** contain interaction records between users and items (products, music, videos).

```python
import pandas as pd
from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Collaborative filtering example
# Create user-item matrix
user_item_matrix = pd.pivot_table(ratings_df, 
                                 values='rating',
                                 index='user_id', 
                                 columns='item_id',
                                 fill_value=0)

# Calculate item similarity
item_similarity = cosine_similarity(user_item_matrix.T)

# Make recommendations
def recommend_items(user_id, num_recommendations=5):
    user_ratings = user_item_matrix.loc[user_id]
    weighted_ratings = item_similarity.dot(user_ratings)
    recommendations = weighted_ratings.argsort()[-num_recommendations:][::-1]
    return recommendations
```

#### Advanced Techniques

**Pearson correlation** measures correlation between inputs for constructing item-item similarity matrices.

**Time decay** reduces older interaction weights over time.

**Inverse user frequency** increases weights for interactions with less popular items.

**Matrix factorization** decomposes user-item matrices into embeddings whose multiplication estimates original matrices.

**Implicit ratings** derive from user behavior rather than explicit surveys.

#### Challenges

**Cold-start problems** occur with new users or items lacking interaction history.

**Echo chambers** happen when recommendations reinforce existing user behavior.

**Shilling attacks** involve users manipulating recommendations through fake interactions.

### Learning to Rank

**Learning to rank** optimizes candidate ordering based on interaction likelihood.

#### Ranking Components

**Candidate generators** output items for ranking, often called "top-k" retrieval.

**Embedding spaces** are n-dimensional spaces where embeddings exist, enabling k-nearest neighbor candidate generation.

**Cosine similarity** measures embedding space similarity as angle cosines between vectors.

```python
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
import numpy as np

# Embedding-based ranking
def rank_candidates(query_embedding, candidate_embeddings, top_k=10):
    similarities = cosine_similarity([query_embedding], candidate_embeddings)[0]
    top_indices = similarities.argsort()[-top_k:][::-1]
    return top_indices, similarities[top_indices]

# Example usage
query_emb = np.random.rand(128)  # Query embedding
candidate_embs = np.random.rand(1000, 128)  # Candidate embeddings

top_candidates, scores = rank_candidates(query_emb, candidate_embs)
```

#### Ranking Metrics

**Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)** evaluates rankings based on position and relevance.

**Mean Average Precision** considers relevance and position for binary ranking scenarios.

**Mean Reciprocal Rank** focuses on the first relevant item's position in rankings.

#### Advanced Features

**Side features** supplement item and user embeddings with additional properties.

**Implicit relevance feedback** derives from user behavior rather than explicit feedback.

**Presentation and trust bias** arise from item placement within rankings.

**Shrinkage** provides learning rates for gradient boosted trees in ranking contexts.
